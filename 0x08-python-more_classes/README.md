## Synopsis
This project is completed as an introduction to the Python programming language.

### Resources 
- A simple introduction to <a href="htps:/python.swaroopch.com/oop.html">Object Oriented Programming</a> without going into much detail:
  - Read everything until the paragraph &quot;Inheritance&quot; excluded
- <a href="htp:/www.python-course.eu/python3_object_oriented_programming.php">Object-Oriented Programming</a>. Please <strong>be careful</strong>: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class, in order to make you beter understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything. Read only the following paragraphs:
  - General Introduction
  - First-class Everything
  - A Minimal Class in Python
  - Atributes
  - Methods
  - The `__init__` Method
  - Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
  - `__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods
  - Public- Protected- and Private Atributes
  - Destructor
- <a href="htp:/www.python-course.eu/python3_class_and_instance_atributes.php">Class and Instance Atributes</a>
- <a href="htp:/www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php">Properties vs. Geters and Seters</a>
- <a href="htp:/brennerm.github.io/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html">`__str__` vs `__repr__`</a>

### Requirements for Python scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Requirements for Python test cases
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c &#39;print(__import__(&quot;my_module&quot;).__doc__)&#39;`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c &#39;print(__import__(&quot;my_module&quot;).MyClass.__doc__)&#39;`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c &#39;print(__import__(&quot;my_module&quot;).my_function.__doc__)&#39;` and `python3 -c &#39;print(__import__(&quot;my_module&quot;).MyClass.my_function.__doc__)&#39;`)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don't miss any edge case
